# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# My comments: Maicol Blanco

I create this project, based on the freeCodeCamp course for fortify my skills

Steps for create an app in Vite:
- npm create vite@latest
You choise the project name and the others steps
? project name:
? package name:
- npm install
- npm run dev

## The First Component:
Is about of the basic use React

## The Second Component:
This component uses React.useState to take control of the state. It is still a basic component but it begins with the use of states.

## The Third Component:
This component is a calculator, here again uses the states, with the onClick events
- In this component we install the package to use the calculator operations 
```bash npm install mathjs ```

## The Fourth Component:
This component is a to-do List, here use React hooks like useState and more events like a onClick(), onChange and onSubmit

* Use the icon pack [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
```
npm install react-icons --save
```

- We install the package to create id 
```
bash npm npm install uuid
```
